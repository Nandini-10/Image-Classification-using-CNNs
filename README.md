# Image-Classification-using-CNNs

## Project Overview
This repository contains implementations and experiments related to image classification using deep learning techniques. The projects include work on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

## Contents

1. **CIFAR-10.ipynb**  
   - This Jupyter notebook contains code and experiments related to the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark in computer vision for classifying 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories.

2. **MNIST.ipynb**  
   - This notebook focuses on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The project explores deep learning techniques to classify these digits.

3. **Images:**
   - \`external_test.jpg\`: An external image used for testing purposes, possibly related to image preprocessing or classification.
   - \`handwritten.jpg\`: A sample handwritten digit image used to validate the MNIST model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

## Usage

- Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
  \`\`\`bash
  jupyter notebook CIFAR-10.ipynb
  jupyter notebook MNIST.ipynb
  \`\`\`

- Follow the steps in each notebook to train and evaluate models.
- Test the model with provided sample images.

## Results

The results of the classification tasks are documented in the notebooks, with visualizations of accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
